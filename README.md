# Weather-Dashboard-App

## Description
I created this weather dashboard application to allow users to search the weather forecast for various cities. It allows them to see the current forecast or the five day forecast for that city. This will hopefully help the user to plan for their day or for a trip with better knowledge of what the weather may be for those days.

## Usage

To use, simply click the link above to bring up the application. You will then be prompted to enter the city name in a search bar.  Enter the name of your city and a current weather forecast will be presented along with the five day forecast of that city. It will also automatially add that city to your search history so that you can quickly check it again in the future. All saved search history cities can also be deleted by simply clicking the trash can to the right of the name.
